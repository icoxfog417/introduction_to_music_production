## Mixing
Mixing is the process that making only 2 track (left and right, stereo sound) from various and multiple tracks.  
And the most important thing in the mixing is to be a guide of listener. You have to think about what kind of sound do you want listener to listen.  

## Channel Strips of Mixing Board
On a mixing board, the signal flows top to bottom, but there are exceptions.

* input section: input from microphone or some audio devices, and adjust line level. Trim knob adjusts the gain of the microphone preamp.
* insert section: out the sound from input section and back it through the some effector, equalizer.
* aux sneds: allow you to route the track to more than one place.
* equalizer section
* pan knob: change the level from two channels. adjust left and right sound for stereo sound by reducing the sound.
* send section: A send controls the level of secondary output.
* mute button: mute button silences a track, and solo button silences all other tracks. volume fader controls the volume (from unity to ~).
* muster bus (section): combined sound comes to this section, and adjust the volume.

## Kinds of Effects
There are 3 kinds of effects. It's called DSP, Digital Signal Processing.

* Dynamic Effects: it's related to the amplitude. it controls the volume based on the material over time. 
 * Compressors
 * Limiters
 * Expanders
 * Noise Gates
* Delay Effects: it's related to the propagation. it gives the space to the listener (sounds like in a large room or small room).
 * Reverbs
 * Delays
 * Phasers
 * Flangers
 * Choruses
* Filter Effects: it's related to the timber. cut high / boost the lows.
 * High Pass Filter
 * Low Pass Filter
 * Band Pass Filter
 * Parametric EQ
 * Graphic EQ
 
These kinds are related to the feature of sound.

## Inserts
Add the Effects to the sound by inserting the plugins.

* Adding inserts
* Bypassing inserts (on/off the insert(effect))
* Choosing presets (plugin's settings for various situations)
* Saving presets
* Changing order of inserts
* Copy / pasting inserts

## Submix
Groups the same kinds of sounds (ex. Snare, Kick Hat = Drum). It's called to Bus(Submix).
If you make submix, you can control the effects or volume to the grouped sounds.

## Sends
Send the sound to the other places. 

* pre fader: it's independent from track fader. it's used to monitor the mix. ex. one is to the audience, and the other is for performer (to listen their own sound).
* post fader: it depends on track fader. it's used to effect the reverbs or delay.

Post fader is mainly used to effect the sounds. Bundle the sounds to the auxiliary line, and make effect like reverbs.

## Automation
Change the volume of sound dynamically and record it. You can also use pencil tool to draw the volume curve.

* Latch: keep the level of automation.
* Touch: overwrite mode. if you stop the automation, it will go back to the previous level.
