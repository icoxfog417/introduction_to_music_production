# Week1

## Microphone
The transducer converts type of singal. Mic is one of transducer that converts sound pressure to voltage power.  

**Mic type**

* dynamic microphone  
Standard mic on stage. It's hard and not so sensitive.
* condenser  
It is sensitive mic. It can pick up sounds in environment.

Condenser microphone needs phantom power.
Microphone has polar pattern. Polar pattern is the area that microphone can pick up sound.  


## Cable

**instrument cable / TS cable**

* quater inch jack
* single conductor
* tip/ sleeve (prevent noise from getting into the cable)
* susceptible to noise -> short cable (= guiter/ microphone)

**TRS/XLR**

* two conductor (single * 2 + shield)
* tip/ring/sleeve
* 1. connect headphones (use as stereo, weak to noise)
* 2. balanced configuration (cancel noise)

XLR is only balance.
    
Convert balance/unbalance -> direct Box(TS -> XLR)
    
**Other**

* eight inch stereo cable -> only stereo, for headphones
* RCA cable -> like TS cable ! -10 level (have to gain state (+4))


## Line Level

The level to communicate with many audio devices (mic, guitar ...).
Some device needs to bring the level up to line level. For example, microphone needs "gain stage" because microphone's power is low.

Gain stage: amplify or attenuate the sound. (be careful, because it sometimes cause noise of distortion)
Unity: no gain stage (use raw).

Not bring up/down signal. Once raise the signal up at the first stage, then get it to line level and keep it there throughout the entire signal flow.
